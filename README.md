# Project 4

## Title

- Coffeholic

## Description

- As a coffee lover, when I'm in town or traveling outside of town, I always like to visit local coffee roasters. This application will allow you to post your favorite coffee shops with pictures and maps. This is a full stack application with CRUD. Google API is used for map data. AWS will be used for future photo upload feature.
